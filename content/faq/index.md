### When will you be running during the summer?

We will be meeting up in the mornings 2-3 days a week during the summer.   As there are a number of holidays we will communicate exactly which days and times via the Band App.  Use the following link to download the App and join the Ben Lomond XC group to be notified of runs <a href="https://band.us/n/a5aa81Wf2de6B">https://band.us/n/a5aa81Wf2de6B</a>

### Who can come run

Any High School and Junior High aged kids (as well as their parents) are free to join us during the summer.

### What if I'm too slow?

We have kids of all different paces so you'll fit right in.  Come out to run regularly and you'll have fun and
get faster as a byproduct.

### What if I don't have any running shoes?

If you don't have any running shoes, talk to one of the coaches as we have a number of shoes donated by our local
running store and community.
