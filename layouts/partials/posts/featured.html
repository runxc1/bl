    <h3>Summer Training</h3>
    <p>
        We'd like to invite you out to come run with the Ben Lomond High Cross Country team this summer.  Our goal is to help kids feel comfortable running and to 
        help them develop a lifelong fitness habit.  Runs during the summer will be tailored to each athlete and will be geared towards having a little more fun
        as it's pre-season running.  High School as well as Junior High aged kids living in the area are invited to come out and run as well as any parents.
